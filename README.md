# SICP - Notes and Exercises

I put this here since it may help someone someday.

Exercises are the `ex*` files.
Notes and code from the chapters are the `ch` files.

## Installation

Download Racket.app.

Use DrRacket.app or start the Racket repl like this:

    /Applications/Racket\ v6.1.1/bin/racket -i -p neil/sicp -l xrepl

This uses the extended repl (xrepl) and the `neil/sicp` language pack.

When I use the Racket repl, I use it in tmux. In one pane is the REPL and in
another is Vim with tslime.vim. This way I can send expressions to the REPL from
Vim with one shortcut.
